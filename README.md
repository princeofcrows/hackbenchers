This a simple news publishing site made with PHP and MYSQL database. 
I made this back in 2015 first when I was learning how to code. 

This is a very poor design and coding and I just jackhammered the project to make a satire publishing app for my class.
You can post, comment and rate each other's news. There are a lot of bugs, not going near there though. This project was a leaning opportunity that ended up becoming a cautionary tale.


But I had a lot of fun making it.
